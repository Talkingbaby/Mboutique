<p class="text-justify">Renowned macarons, French delights of the moment can be met in a variety of flavors and colors and are
    brilliant precisely because of
    their simplicity - a crispy coating, but delicate in a loose blanket jam, chocolate-butter cream is
    spread inviting.</p>
<p class="text-justify">
    Macarons combine perfectly with champagne or white wine, tea or hot chocolate, fresh juices and
    naturally fruit flavored coffee
    and gaurantee that these little delights soon become a friend that you can not break.
